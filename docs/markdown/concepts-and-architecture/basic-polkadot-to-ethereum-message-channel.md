*todo - explain basics, minutely mmr commitments, forced message ordering, flat commitment batch processing, maximum gas usage per message constraints to guarantee deliverability. ?though what about attack vector of attacker flooding with broken messages? maybe still have basic fee structure? or maybe remove strict ordering constraint and go with nonce keyvalue kinda thing again? what about the verification of commitments tho then? go merkle tree or get redundant?*
